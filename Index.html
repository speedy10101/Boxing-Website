			<p1>
			  <p>Hello, my name is Tony Kamau and I am head coach at Contenders Boxing Gym Newport. I have been involved with boxing all my life and love teaching this disciplined skill in a safe, controlled environment to local people in the Newport area. If you are interested in coming to a training session we have three evenings a week where we train (you can check the time out below). Whether you are a novice or an expert Contenders Boxing Gym is open to everyone - if you just want to lose weight or want to become a pro boxer. Everyone is welcome! We have both junior and senior classes, both are done at the same hardcore intensity although the senior sessions run for two hours instead of one. Please feel free to contact me if you have any queries,</p>
			  <p>Tony<br>
